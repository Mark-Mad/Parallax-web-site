      <h2>Heroes' Square </h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Hősök tere</strong> is surrounded by two important buildings, <i>Museum of Fine Arts</i> on the left and <i>Palace of Art </i>(or more accurately Hall of Art) on the right. On the other side it faces Andrássy Avenue which has two buildings looking at the square – one is residential and the other one is the embassy of Serbia (former Yugoslavian embassy where Imre Nagy secured sanctuary in 1956).
      </p>
      <p>
        The central feature of Heroes' Square, as well as a landmark of Budapest, is the Millennium Memorial (Hungarian: Millenáriumi Emlékmű, also translated Millennium Monument or Millennial Monument). Construction began in 1896 to commemorate the thousandth anniversary of the Hungarian conquest of the Carpathian Basin and the foundation of the Hungarian state in 1896, and was part of a much larger construction project which also included the expansion and refurbishing of Andrássy Avenue and the construction of the first metro line in Budapest. Construction was mostly completed in 1900, which was when the square received its name. The four allegoric sculptures were added in 1906, the monument as a whole basically looked like it does today (except for the kings' statues), complete with the surrounding museums on either side, and it was inaugurated still in the same year, 1906.

      <h2>Gellért Hill</h2>
      <p>
        The first recorded names of the hill in the Middle Ages were Kelen-hegy, Pesti-hegy (Pest Hill) and Blocksberg. From the 15th century it has been called Szent Gellért hegye (The hill of St. Gerard) referring to the legend about the death of St. Gerard. The bishop was assassinated by the pagans during the great pagan rebellion in 1046. He was put in a barrel and rolled down into the deep from the top of the hill.

        The former name, Pesti-hegy (Latin: Mons Pestiensis) referred to the large cave in the hillside. The word is probably of Slavic origin and means oven or cave.

        The Ottoman Turks called the hill Gürz Elyas bayiri. Gürz Elyas was a holy man from the Bektashi order whose shrine and grave on top of the hill was a place of pilgrimage in the 17th century.
